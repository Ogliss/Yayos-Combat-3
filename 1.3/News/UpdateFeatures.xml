탄약 꺼내기 기능 추가. 탄약이 들어있는 무기를 우클릭 하여 탄약을 꺼낼 수 있습니다.



# NOTICE #

- Ammunition System -

Adds an ammo system to a simple rim world. This is a feature that is disabled by default. If you want this feature please turn on this in mod option.


- Setup -

Most features can be turned off or changed in the options.


- Armor algorithm -

If the penetration of a weapon is high, the durability of the armor is sharply reduced.

Reduce enemy armor's durability first with weapons with high tech levels and high penetration. And put the bullets at the weakened ones
This also applies to mechanoids, where the bullet hits when the hp is below a certain value.

Use the newly added weapon, anti-armor rocket launcher, when fighting powerful armor enemies.
